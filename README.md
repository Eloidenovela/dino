# Dino ðŸ¦–

Welcome to the **Dino** repository! This project was created as part of my **Data Structures and Algorithms** course in college. The name "Dino" was chosen to symbolize the complexity and robustness of this subject, much like the grandeur of dinosaurs!

## Description

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in **C** and **C++**. The goal is to explore and learn the fundamental concepts of computer science while developing essential skills for solving complex computational problems.

### Data Structures

- Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

### Algorithms

- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Dynamic Programming

## Tools and Technologies

- **Languages**: C, C++
- **Build System**: [Xmake](https://xmake.io/)
  - Xmake will be used to manage the builds and dependencies of the project, making it easier to compile and run the algorithms and data structures.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eloidenovela/dino.git
   cd dino
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**

   Make sure [Xmake](https://xmake.io/) is installed on your machine.

   ```bash
   xmake
   ```

3. **Run Tests:**

   ```bash
   xmake run tests
   ```
